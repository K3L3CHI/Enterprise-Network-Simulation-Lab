# âœ… PHASE 10 â€“ Audit Policies & Monitoring  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
Establish auditing and monitoring across the domain to track key security-related actions, ensuring visibility into logons, file access, process activity, and policy changes.  

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Completed  
- âœ… Enabled **Advanced Audit Policies** via Group Policy:  
  - Logon Events  
  - Object Access  
  - Account Management  
  - Process Creation  
- âœ… Created **Event Viewer filters** on DC and WS for quick visibility of key events.  
- âœ… Deployed GPO so all domain-joined machines follow the same audit settings.  
- âœ… Installed **Sysmon** on DC and WS.  
- âœ… Applied a **Sysmon configuration file** to capture detailed events (process creation, network connections, etc.).  
- âœ… Verified logs in **Event Viewer â†’ Microsoft â†’ Windows â†’ Sysmon â†’ Operational**.
