# ðŸ§­ Enterprise Network Simulation Lab (ENSL)

A phase-by-phase **home lab project** simulating real-world enterprise network and system administration.  

This is my self-built **Enterprise IT Home Lab** where I simulated how organizations manage users, networks, security, and updates â€” from scratch to completion.  

I currently work as an **E-Fraud & Forensic Investigation Analyst**, but I have a strong passion for **Networks, Systems Administration, and Security**.  
This lab allowed me to learn step-by-step, implement key IT infrastructure concepts, and document the entire journey publicly.  

Built using **VirtualBox** with **Windows Server 2016** and **Windows 10 Workstations**.

- Document the process like a real Systems Administrator  
- Build a hands-on portfolio for a future IT/Security career path
