# âœ… PHASE 9 â€“ Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) & Patching  

## Goal  
Implement centralized patch management using **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)** to control how updates are delivered, tested, and approved across domain-joined machines.  

## âœ… Completed Tasks  
- Installed and configured **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)** role on ENSL-DC01 with local content storage.  
- Set up computer groups in WSUS (e.g., Workstations) for client targeting.  
- Created and linked a WSUS **Group Policy Object (GPO)** to the **General Workstation OU**:  
  - Pointed clients to WSUS server (`http://ENSL-DC01:8530`).  
  - Enabled client-side targeting (auto-assign WS01 to Workstations).  
  - Configured automatic updates (download + scheduled install).  
- Forced client registration: confirmed **Enterprise-WS01** reports to WSUS.  
- Ran synchronization with Microsoft Update â†’ downloaded available patches.  
- Approved targeted updates (e.g., Windows Defender definition updates) for deployment.  
- Verified on **Enterprise-WS01** that approved updates are detected, downloaded, and installed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome  
- Domain-joined workstations now receive updates from the **internal WSUS server** instead of directly from the internet.  
- This enables **controlled patch testing, approval, and deployment** â€” ensuring security while reducing external bandwidth usage.
