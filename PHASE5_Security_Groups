# Phase 5 – Security Groups & Permissions  

## Goal  
Start applying user/group management and prepare for GPO testing.  

## Tasks Completed  
- Created Security Groups for departments:  
  - SG_FINANCE_USER (Global) — in Finance OU  
  - SG_HUMANRESOURCE_USER (Global) — in Human Resource OU  
  - SG_IT_ADMIN (Global) — in IT OU  
  - SG_IT_USER (Global) — in IT OU  
  - SG_TESTLAB_USER (Global) — in Test Lab OU  
- Assigned users to appropriate groups:  
  - Adam Smith → SG_FINANCE_USER  
  - Adeleke Chigozie → SG_HUMANRESOURCE_USER  
  - Michael Faraday → SG_IT_ADMIN  
  - Ciroma Adekunle → SG_IT_USER  
  - Elijah Michaelson → SG_TESTLAB_USER  
- Documented group scopes and types (All SGs are Global scope, Security type)  
- Delegation of control using security groups: ✅ Michael Faraday (in SG_IT_ADMIN) delegated control
